# Anemia Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to detect anemia levels in children based on various health parameters. The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and evaluated using different train-test splits. Additionally, a MobileNetV2 model is used for image-based analysis.
